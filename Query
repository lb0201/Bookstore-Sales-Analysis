//Project Overview:
//In this data analysis project, we aim to analyze a dataset containing information about book sales and customer preferences. 
//The dataset includes tables for Customers, Orders, Publisher, Author, Books, OrderItems, and more. 
//Our goal is to gain insights into book sales patterns, and customer preferences, and identify the best-selling book.


//Analyze book sales trends, including the total number of orders and sales revenue over time.
