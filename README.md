##  Project Title 

SQL Bookstore Sales Analysis

##  Description

In this project, we aim to analyze a dataset containing information about bookstore sales and customer preferences. The dataset includes tables for Customers, Orders, Publisher, Author, Books, OrderItems, and more. Our goal is to gain insights into book sales patterns, customer preferences, and identify the best selling book.

Business related questions:
* Analyze book sales trends, including the total number of orders and sales revenue over time
* Identify the best selling book and its corresponding sales revenue
* Identify the month with the highest book sales and the best selling book for that month

Analyzed results and outcome: 
* Based on the given data, it can be inferred that "BODYBUILD IN 10 MINUTES A DAY" is the best-selling book in April, and its popularity may be attributed to people's plans to get in shape before summer.
* Therefore, it can be concluded that if the bookstore sells more books related to bodybuilding and fitness, it can potentially increase its profits. With the data suggesting that this particular book performs well in April due to the upcoming summer season and people's interest in fitness goals, the bookstore can strengthen its marketing and merchandising efforts for books related to bodybuilding, exercise, health, diet, and nutrition. The bookstore can attract customers' attention and encourage purchases by offering a diverse selection of fitness-related books and organizing related events or promotions.
